# ReignBot

ReignBot is a Java application built to automatically harvest crops for the online game [Reign](http://reign.ws/).

Unfortunately, I've just hard-coded in my session information, so you'll have to modify the source to add your own
credentials until I get around to finishing the login functionality. Other than that problem, the program should work just fine.
